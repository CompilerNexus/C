# Revive C compilers by Dennis Ritchie

I would like to update the Unix V7 C compiler by Dennis Ritchie to a modern
architecture. 

## Versions

The code from `V7` is in the `V7` branch.
Other versions are in `V10` and `2.11BSD` branch.

The `master` contains the version that I am working on.

## Sub Projects

* `cc` contains the compiler code
* `cpp` is a C pre-processor written by Dennis Ritchie.
* `docs` contains a design document for the C compiler written by Dennis Ritchie.

## Current Status

See the `cc` subproject for its status.
